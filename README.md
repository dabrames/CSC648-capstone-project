# csc648-team11

This project was created with a group of six members in a Senior Capstone style course in Spring '18.  The general idea was to create a website that people could report any environmental/maintenance issues to be seen by city workers to fix.  Over the course of the semester my group implemented the website with these features:

# Self-Check: Adherence to Original Priority List
1.	All users shall be able to search for Reports by zip code.
2.	All users shall be able to search for Reports by Park name.
3.	All users shall be able to view the status of submitted Reports.
4.	All users shall be able to view the location of the park in submitted Reports through Google Maps.
5.	Unregistered Users shall be allowed to fill out a Report, but must register to submit the Report.
6.	Registered Users shall be able to post images when submitting a Report.
7.	Registered Users shall be able to log in using a username and password.
8.	City Users shall be able to view all Reports submitted by users.
9.	City Users and Admins shall be able to view user information attached to submitted Reports.
10.	City Users shall be able to adjust the Status of a submitted Report between open, in-progress, and complete.
11.	Admins shall be able to delete submitted Reports, by using PGAdmin.
12.	Admins shall not be able to edit submitted Reports.
13.	Admins shall be able to delete user accounts, by using PGAdmin.


# Self-Check: Adherence to Original Non-Functional Specs
1.	DONE - Application shall be developed, tested and deployed using tools and servers approved by Class CTO and as agreed in M0 (some may be provided in the class, some may be chosen by the student team but all tools and servers have to be approved by class CTO).
2.	DONE - Application shall be optimized for standard desktop/laptop browsers e.g. must render correctly on the two latest versions of all major browsers: Mozilla, Safari, Chrome. 
3.	DONE - Application shall have responsive UI code so it can be adequately rendered on mobile devices but no mobile native app is to be developed.
4.	DONE - Data shall be stored in the team’s chosen database technology on the team’s deployment server.
5.	DONE - Application shall be media rich (at minimum contain images and maps).
6.	DONE - No more than 50 concurrent users shall be accessing the application at any time.
7.	DONE - Privacy of users shall be protected and all privacy policies will be appropriately communicated to the users.
8.	DONE - The language used shall be English. 
9.	DONE - Application shall be very easy to use and intuitive. 
10.	DONE - Google analytics shall be added.
11.	DONE - No email clients shall be allowed.
12.	DONE - Pay functionality, if any (e.g. paying for goods and services) shall not be implemented nor simulated.
13.	DONE - Site security: basic best practices shall be applied (as covered in the class).
14.	DONE - Modern SE processes and practices shall be used as specified in the class, including collaborative and continuous SW development.
15.	DONE - The website shall prominently display the following exact text on all pages "SFSU Software Engineering Project, Spring 2018.  For Demonstration Only” at the top of the WWW page. (Important so as to not confuse this with a real application).
